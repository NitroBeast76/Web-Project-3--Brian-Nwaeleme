                    <li>The amount of land given was smaller than what was demanded by the Indigenous leaders later, apart from Treaty 5</li>
                    <li>The right to fish and hunt were not explicit</li>
                    <li>It had cultural clashes as the Canadian government meant total surrender while the Indigenous meant mutual sharing</li>
