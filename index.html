        <p>
            Treaty 1 was signed on August 3 1871, at Lower Fort Garry, was the first of the Numbered Treaties and fostered the creation of Manitoba as a whole. It was agreed upon by the Canadian Government and the Anishinabek and Swampy Cree peoples of southern Manitoba who both had different goals as a whole. The Canadian Government wanted land for expansion and to settle colonists, while the Indigenous were pursuing their survival and protection of their culture for their descendants.

        <!-- List of topics to be discussed -->
        <p>We will be discussing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Where the Treaty was negotiated and a picture of the location of the negotiation?</li>
            <li>A map of the Treaty area displayed.</li>
            <li>See the Treaty map in context, meaning, a bigger map with a coloured chunk showing where this Treaty territory is.</li>
            <li>What communities are involved and what their ethnic affiliation is or what Nation theyâ€™re from.</li>
            <li>What are the historic terms of the Treaty, meaning what was included in the Treaty (ex. the outside promises, how much land each family of five were to receive, etc.).</li>
            <li>What makes this Treaty different from other Treaties in Canada.</li>
            <li>How is the Treaty being implemented today. For example, information about urban reserves (ex. Kapyong Urban Reserve, Long Plain First Nations Gas Station, etc.) or economic development in Treaty communities.</li>
        </ul>
