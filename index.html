        <p>
            Treaty 1 was signed on August 3 1871, at Lower Fort Garry, was the first of the Numbered Treaties and fostered the creation of Manitoba as a whole. It was agreed upon by the Canadian Government and the Anishinabek and Swampy Cree peoples of southern Manitoba who both had different goals as a whole. The Canadian Government wanted land for expansion and to settle colonists, while the Indigenous were pursuing their survival and protection of their culture for their descendants.
